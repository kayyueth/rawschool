        Crypto Wars: The Fight for Privacy in the Digital Age
      </h1>

        The crypto wars have raged for half a century. In the 1970s, digital
        privacy activists prophesied the emergence of an Orwellian State, made
        possible by computer-mediated mass surveillance. The antidote: digital
        encryption. The U.S. government warned encryption would not only prevent
        surveillance of law-abiding citizens, but of criminals, terrorists, and
        foreign spies, ushering in a rival dystopian future. Both parties fought
        to defend the citizenry from what they believed the most perilous
        threats. The government tried to control encryption to preserve its
        surveillance capabilities; privacy activists armed citizens with
        cryptographic tools and challenged encryption regulations in the courts.
